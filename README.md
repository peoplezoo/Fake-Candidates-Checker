In today's digital hiring landscape, ensuring the authenticity of candidates is more important than ever. The Fake Candidates Checker is designed to meticulously analyze LinkedIn profiles for potential red flags. It looks for signs such as newly created accounts, minimal connections, and suspicious work histories. By cross-referencing profile photos across platforms like LinkedIn and using reverse image search, it detects mismatches and AI-generated images.

This tool verifies LinkedIn URLs to ensure they lead to valid profiles and checks for discrepancies in Work at a Startup profiles. It validates company work histories against databases of known fraudulent companies, flagging profiles with abuse scores or "bad actor" tags. Additionally, it identifies suspicious communication patterns, such as the use of VoIP numbers, reluctance to engage in video calls, insistence on remote-only work, and requests to ship equipment to mismatched addresses.

The system assigns comprehensive risk scores based on various fraud indicators and identifies patterns common among fraudulent candidates, such as unusual tagging behavior or incomplete profiles. It highlights candidates who require enhanced screening through background checks and reference calls, helping companies identify potential fraudulent candidates, including those linked to organized schemes like North Korean IT worker infiltration attempts, before they enter the hiring process.
